#Interactive Newton's Cradle Physics Simulation
Built with JavaScript, Matter.js, and p5.js

Overview
This project is a browser-based, interactive simulation of Newton's Cradle — the classic physics demonstration device — built using the Matter.js physics engine and the p5.js creative coding library. Designed to illustrate conservation of momentum and energy in a fun, visual, and interactive way.

Features
Physics-Accurate Simulation:
Leverages Matter.js to simulate pendulum ball collisions and realistic rope constraints.

Responsive Design:
Rendered using p5.js for smooth animations and canvas management.

Customizable:
Easily tweak physical parameters (number of balls, lengths, forces) in code for further experimentation or demo purposes.

Educational Utility:
Ideal for showcasing physics fundamentals or creative coding skills in a portfolio.

Usage
Clone this repo

bash
git clone https://github.com/Mokksh-bhatt/project-27.git
Run index.html
Open in any modern browser.

No server required; all simulation code runs client-side.

Technologies Used
Matter.js: Rigid-body physics engine for realistic motion and collisions.

p5.js: Creative coding library for rendering and interactivity.

JavaScript (ES6+)

File Structure
index.html: Main webpage entry.

sketch.js: p5.js animation loop and simulation setup.

Matter.js, p5.play.js, p5.sound.js: Libraries.

Ball.js, Roof.js: Custom objects for simulation entities.

Screenshot
(Add a running simulation screenshot here for recruiters to see visual impact.)

Recruiter-Focused Highlights
Hands-on physics and simulation programming (relevant to technical roles in JS, games, web, STEM, and education).

Readable, modular code with OOP design (shows software engineering best practices).

Cross-library integration: Combining advanced JS libraries for custom UIs.
